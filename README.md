### You can find more information [HERE](https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/blob/master/README/WEBSITES.md)

### For Developers
If you want to develop on Porn Fetch and do local changes, contribute code or do whatever, please
have a look at the internal code documentation which explains the core structure of the project,
as well as the different concepts used here.

See: https://github.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/blob/master/README/FOR_DEVELOPERS.md


## 🔨 Building from Source
Building will be done through a fully automated script, that lets you select the version / commit to 
build from and will install all dependencies automatically for you, including Python.

> [!NOTE]
> Building will be done using Python3.13.11 and [Nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka) using Qt's `pyside6-deploy` tool.

Hardware requirements:
- Electricity
- CPU
- RAM 
- GPU (optional)
- SSD (optional)
- Red Star OS 4.0 or similar (although with x64 🥀)

> Compilation takes around 20-60 minutes depending on your system and hardware.

### Linux / macOS
> [!NOTE]
> There is no official list of tested Linux distributions. I develop Porn Fetch only on Arch Linux. If you come across
> an issue, you can always report it and I will distro-hop to solve it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If using macOS, you need to install XCode developer tools and Homebrew.

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install.sh" -o install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Termux
> [!NOTE]
> You do **NOT** need a rooted Android device to compile and run Porn Fetch on Android

```bash
apt install wget -y && wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EchterAlsFake/Porn_Fetch/master/src/scripts/install_termux.sh" | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell as Admin)
> [!CAUTION]
> You absolutely **NEED** to disable Microsoft Defender (Realtime protection). Otherwise, Windows will just randomly delete
> files during build which makes it completely impossible to do anything.

# Sponsoring / Donations
Porn Fetch is developed entirely Open-Source and will always be free, because I like what
I am doing here. I will never ever charge money for this software.

However, I kindly ask every one of you to donate a small amount of money. If you have Monero (crypto)
or PayPal, you can donate me here:

- Paypal: `https://paypal.me/EchterAlsFake` (Prefered)
- Monero: `42XwGZYbSxpMvhn9eeP4DwMwZV91tQgAm3UQr6Zwb2wzBf5HcuZCHrsVxa4aV2jhP4gLHsWWELxSoNjfnkt4rMfDDwXy9jR`
- Ko-Fi : `https://ko-fi.com/EchterAlsFake`

Even if it's just 10 cents, for me, it matters, because I do not work yet and it means a lot
to me :)
